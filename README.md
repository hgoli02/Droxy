## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a TUN/TAP virtual interface for manipulating outgoing TCP packets. The implementation includes setting up a client-server communication using a handshake mechanism, handling packet processing, and EDNS packet encapsulation. Key features include:

- Creation of TUN interface for routing and manipulating network traffic.
- Client-server handshake mechanism for establishing secure communication.
- Detailed packet processing pipeline with TCP and EDNS handling.

## Key Technologies
- Python
- Socket Programming
- TUN/TAP Device Handling
- EDNS (Extension mechanisms for DNS)
